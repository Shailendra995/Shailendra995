### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

As a PhD student specializing in Artificial Intelligence at Oslo Metropolitan University, Oslo, Norway, my academic journey has transitioned from my Master's in ACIT Data Science.

- ðŸ”­ I am currently dedicated to a new research endeavor, the "Virtual-Eye" project, diverging from my Master's thesis topic.
- ðŸŒ± My educational focus now includes advanced AI concepts, while continuing to enhance my knowledge in machine learning, deep learning, statistics, quantum computing, cellular automata, and Quantum IT.
